    Dogix - For being the first person to offer me a chance to show of what i am capable. if it wasn't for the Bark/Ancestor merge then i would of quit sooner.
    
    SnowyShiro - Overall my backbone. A VERY good person who is always there when i need him. I can't simplify the greatness in this simple line. Thankyou for being a great friend regardless of my resentment towards you

    Oddy - Despite our "Wars" he has always been a good friend

    Drizzy/JayZone and Samuel - Always being there for my stupid ideas and continued to support them regardless <3

    JB36 - Despite the recent resentment i've felt i still see you and your community in a good light <3
